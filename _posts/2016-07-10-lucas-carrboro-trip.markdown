## Morning 
After struggling awake at 9AM, Xueer and I began the day slow, but intent on traveling. 
I prepared breakfast for myself and Xueer: a light portion of egg and toast. 

We decided to go to Carrboro along the Southern route. I wanted to drive for longer and get a quick glimpse at Jordan Lake.

After passing Jordan Lake, and continuing North to Carrboro, we found parking and attended the Carrboro Farmer's Market.

The Farmer's Market was hosting a Tomato Taste Testing event, including at least twenty different kinds of tomatoes to taste or buy. Xueer's eagle eye's caught some older lady accidently spitting a tomato back into a dish, so we covertly skipped that particular opportunity. All of the tomatoes had interesting variations in texture or sweetness. Halfway through the tomato taste test, which was hosted within the shaded gazebo, cheese was provided as a taste contrast.

## Midday

After being Summer heat for an extended period of time, we were ready for a climate-controlled haven: the Ackland Art Museum. They were exhibiting the American Photography of Burk Uzzle. In addition to being very striking imagery, Uzzle managed to capture some of the most tumultuous events of American history. From The death of Martin Luther King Junior, to Woodstock, to the Anti-War campaigns of the late 1960's early 1970's, Uzzle captured the spirit of American youth counter-culture. One of my favorite exhibited photographs follows:

In addition to this exhibition, their regular collection was on display, consisting of culture pieces from time periods stretching form Ancient Egypt to 19th century European Realism. Some of the most interesting pieces were Asian Ceramic and Container work, like this Chinese "Hill Jar":

After spending some relaxing time with art and air conditioning, we grabbed lunch at Cholanad, and Indian Place on West Franklin Street. 
We got 3 rounds of Naan Bread to start,

and had an order of Chicken Tikka Masala (with bread, no rice).

After eating so much bread, Xueer and I were stuffed to the gills. The bread was fantastic, and I'm personally not even a fan of Indian food. We left with a good portion of leftovers. 

We might even be on [Google Maps Streetview][google-maps] at some point in the future!


## Overall
A pleasant, short, day-trip to Carrboro. I would like to return to explore the night life of the college bars and music venues near Chapel Hill. I would especially like to see if there is a good music show or two at the Cat's Cradle. 

Overall Rating: 68 bread loafs out of 100.
